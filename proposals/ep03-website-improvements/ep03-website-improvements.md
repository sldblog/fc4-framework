# FC4 Enhancement Proposal EP03: Website Improvements

This Enhancement Proposal is:

* By [Avi Flax](https://github.com/aviflax/)
* Part of [a batch of proposals](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/issues/72) being discussed and considered (initially) in October 2018

## Summary

I’ve held one workshop for FC4, and it didn’t go very well — I’d pointed people to [the website](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/) and suggested that they review [the methodology](https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/methodology/) beforehand, but it didn’t work for them. I’ve also attempted to show the website to a few people in an ad-hoc mode, just to give them a quick glimpse of the framework, and I’ve seen their eyes glaze over.

I propose that we do a little research in order to identify the most promising potential changes that would improve the effectiveness of the website, especially the methodology section, and implement those changes.

## In Depth

The problem seems to be that every page of the website is basically just [a wall of text](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/issues/71). Some of the walls are mostly paragraphs and some are mostly outlines, but the fact remains that they're mostly just [walls of text](https://www.theonion.com/nation-shudders-at-large-block-of-uninterrupted-text-1819571366) that hurt people’s eyes before they even try to read them. Honestly they probably just look boring and unappealing to the reader, who just doesn't bother.

I suspect the website needs to be spruced up by adding images, summaries, pull quotes, etc — things like that that will make the pages more visually appealing, friendlier, and less imposing.

It’s also possible that some fundamental design improvements might help, such as using a nicer serif typeface, a larger font size, more line spacing, shorter line lengths, etc. E.G. some of the nuances described in [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/10-principles-for-readable-web-typography/).

This excellent conference talk also seems relevant: [How to Write Documentation for People that Don't Read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQP_hUNCrcE) by [Kevin Burke](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/speakers/#speaker-kburke) at [Write the Docs 2015](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/).
